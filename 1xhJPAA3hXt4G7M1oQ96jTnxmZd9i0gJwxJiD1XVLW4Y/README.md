Watch this video first before exploring the lesson plan.</p><p><br>Students learn how neural networks work. They first discuss an example of an experience that recommends things to you. They then use a widget that recommends videos based on one person. Students watch a video explaining neural networks. They use an updated widget to adjust the weights of each person. Finally, students discuss the need for diverse perspectives when creating recommendation systems.</p><p><br>More guidance and resources for this lesson are available in the Lesson Plan:<br><a href="https://studio.code.org/s/how-ai-works-2023/lessons/3">https://studio.code.org/s/how-ai-works-2023/lessons/3</a><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

For example, they may be recommended videos from Youtube or new songs on a music app. Some apps may ask you to pick preferences before using them to help figure out your preferences. Some websites give recommendations at the end of an experience, like a takeout menu or online grocery store recommending new items before checking out. Try to crowdsource a variety of examples before continuing to the next prompt<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Instead, focus on the tension between getting recommendations that are accurate and how not every recommendation may feel like it matches each student's interests and personality.<br><br>üéôÔ∏è <strong>Say:</strong> We get recommended things all the time, but how do these programs know what to recommend? How do they get better? Today we're going to look at one way computers create recommendations using something called neural networks.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

There‚Äôs gotta be a way to combine these different perspectives to fine-tune the recommendations that we get. Let‚Äôs look at how computer science and artificial intelligence can help with that!<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
