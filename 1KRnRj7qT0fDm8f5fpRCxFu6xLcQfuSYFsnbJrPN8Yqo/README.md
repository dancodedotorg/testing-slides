Each sprite can be a little different and you can set the properties with code.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Have them go to <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/pilot-k5-game-design/lessons/1/levels/2">Level 2</a>. Remind them to follow the instructions on each level, click on the light bulb for hints and read the feedback in the yellow box under the instructions if something is not quite right in their code.<br><br>Teaching Tip: Independent Work Time<br>In Levels 2-16, students will be following instructions and working at their own pace. Here are a few tips that should help students while they're working through the levels:<br>Collaborate with Neighbors: Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using <a href="https://youtu.be/vgkahOzFH2Q">pair programming.</a><br>Read the Instructions: The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before giving students the answer, ensure they've carefully looked at the instructions, hints, videos, and any starter code carefully.<br>Stuck? Look for hints: Each level includes a hint with advice for how to pass a level, including which blocks of code to try out.<br>Take your time and experiment. The instructions tell students generally what to do, but they should also feel free to try out their own ideas.<br><br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

After everyone has an answer, discuss as a class. Repeat for all three scenarios.<br><br>…to arrange 8 enemies in a perfect line? [Answer: Code C because with the grid block you can easily place multiple sprites exactly where you want them to go]<br><br>… to make a game with 100 randomly placed gems to collect? [Answer: Code B because with this block you can choose the number of sprites and they will be randomly placed on screen]<br><br>…to set the location of one player at the beginning of the game? [Answer: Code A because with this block you are placing just one sprite at a time and setting the location with x,y coordinates]<br><br>🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> When we are coding there are often many different ways to program the same thing.

How do you win/lose?<br><br>💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> By looking at the code, we can make a guess about how to play. We can see the unicorn’s behavior is set to `moving with arrow keys` so we know we will be controlling the unicorn with arrow keys. We see that the unicorn gives us instructions to “Avoid the fireballs!” so we know we have to try not to let the fireballs touch the unicorn. Under the event `when unicorn touches fireball` we see the unicorn goes away and the game is over so we can assume that’s how you would lose the game. By looking closely at each line of code, students will gain confidence and experience reading the code blocks and understanding the purpose of each block.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Similarly, Level 12 is an open ended project meaning you can have students spend as much or as little time on it as is left in the class session.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Consider having students write their answers individually before discussing as a class if you would like to use as a check for understanding of the newly introduced concept of game mechanics.<br><br>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> What are the game mechanics of the classic Frogger game?<br><br>💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students will be able to explain how the frog moves on the screen, and the basic objective and rules of the game.<br><br>An example response might be: “In this game the player controls the frog by moving it up, down, right, or left. The goal is to get across the road and then across the river. If the frog touches a car, it has to start over. If the frog touches the water, it has to try crossing again by jumping on top of turtles and logs as they move.<br><br><br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

How does your game know which sprites should act like walls or floors and which sprite is the player? A sprite’s type helps identify them and determine how they interact with sprites of other types. For example, “player” sprites might be able to jump, while “environment” sprites stop other sprites from moving through them.<br></p><p>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> As a class or in pairs, read over the different sprite types explained on <a href="http://studio.code.org/s/pilot-k5-game-design/lessons/3/levels/4">level 4</a>.

What makes a game not so fun?<br><br>💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students may come up with a wide variety of answers for these questions and many will be personal preferences. Continue advancing the discussions until they can find some things they all agree on.

Let’s get our creativity warmed up with some quick brainstorming<br></p><p>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Use the steps listed to come up with 3-5 games very quickly as a whole class. The purpose of this warm up is to model quick decision making by keeping the ideas simple. Show how students can make up parts of the game – without including too many details – and then move on to the next idea.<br><br>Open both spinners in their own tabs: <a href="https://wheelofnames.com/wkm-e9j">Game Mechanic Spinner Link</a>, <a href="https://wheelofnames.com/e6p-gd3">Game Character Spinner Link</a><br>Spin to randomly select a game mechanic.<br>Spin to choose the main character.<br>With your randomly selected game mechanic and character, use the sentence stems on the slide to brainstorm a silly game.<br><br>The goal is to keep it simple, silly and quick-paced. Here are some examples you might come up with:<br>- You spun ‘avoid’ &#x26; ‘grumpy cat’. In this game the grumpy cat tries to avoid the floating hearts. The variable would be named grumpyLevel and it would decrease when the cat touches the heart.<br>- You spun ‘click’ and ‘sassy fox.’ In this game the player tries to click on the sassy fox but she keeps disappearing and changing her location so it’s challenging to catch her. The variable would be named score and it would increase each time the player clicks on the sassy fox before she disappears.<br>- You spun ‘move’ and ‘chill sloth.’ In this game the chill sloth is moving extremely slow and the player tries to move him to his food before the fast ants eat it all. The variable would be named food. It would increase when the sloth touches the food and decrease when the ants touch the food.<br><br></p> |

This way, when they return to their own computer and Activity Guide, it will be full of user data specific to their game which they will use to complete pages 4 - 5 in the second half of the lesson.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Each member of the team from the game jam will open the game on their own computer. If they have set up pair programming properly, they will all have access to the game the made in Lesson 4 Level 3.<br><br>🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> We are setting up for user testing today! User testing help will you make your game even more awesome by seeing how real players like it. You’ll use their feedback to figure out how to make your game better before sharing it with the world! It is okay if your game still needs some work. It can be really helpful to get user feedback before the project is complete so you know what is most important to work on to finish it up.<br><br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

That wraps up our game design module. We have gone from the basics of adding sprites to being able to keep track of changing data/information in a variable and then check when it reaches a certain value in a conditional statement to create a winning or losing condition in a game. We have worked as teams in a fun Game Jam just like game developers do in the real world. Then we conducted user tests to collect data and make decisions on how to improve our games. You can keep creating games of your own in Sprite Lab anytime!<br></p><p>Teaching Tip: Wrapping up the module<br>This is where the game design module concludes but you may wish to offer another lesson where students can implement the feedback they received.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
