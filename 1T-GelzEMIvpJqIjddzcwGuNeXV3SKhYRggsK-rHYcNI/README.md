Tell students they will revisit this question at the end of the lesson. <br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide9.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Have students discuss different ways of grouping these items in groups of 3 and to explain their reasoning. Some examples are by: shape, color, photo orientation, and toppings. You can also get students thinking like a computer. Ask them “How would a computer tell the difference between these four items? What would it need to know about each pastry?”<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should understand that there are different ways of grouping and sorting the same items based on their features. <br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide10.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide11.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Have students list the different features they see on these items. Take time to think about what these items would look like if they were sorted vs. how they appear on screen.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should notice that there are 3 different shapes (triangle, circle, square), 3 different border colors (red, green, black), and 3 different fill colors (yellow, white, red). They should explain that the items are not sorted because they are all grouped together, regardless of their features.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide12.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> For the first time through this activity, the teacher (or “Trainer”) will be given a set of sorted data. The students are the computers that are being trained on the model. At first, they will guess and check their categorizations. As they get more information, they will learn what the model is and how the items have been sorted.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide13.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Transition students to their devices. Have them go to level one and wait for their next instructions. <br /><br />Note: This level starts out with all of the items together in the top of the screen. Students will click and drag items one at a time into the 3 boxes. They will click “Reset” when they finish and reuse this same level for Part Two.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide14.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Tell students to click the orange Run button under the playspace and look for the item on screen. Be careful to refer to this as an “item” and not a triangle to convey that a computer doesn’t understand shape. Have students store this item in one of the three boxes by clicking and dragging it into the box.<br /><br />Students will act as the Computer “Guesser” trying to determine what box to put this in. Since students won’t have enough information yet to know where the item should go, they should take a guess. <br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide15.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Ask students “What features does this item have?” They should note that it is shaped like a triangle, it has a green border, and it has a yellow fill color. Ask students how they decided what box to put it in. <br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students may say that they took a guess or that they looked at specific features of the item. Both ways reflect how a computer would also decide what box to put the item in. <br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide16.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students move the item into Box 1 if it is not already there.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide17.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students locate and move these three items into Boxes 1, 2, and 3 respectively.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide18.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students store this item in one of the three boxes by clicking and dragging it into the box.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide19.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Ask students where this item could be sorted into. Then ask what information they could receive that would help them to be more accurate in sorting additional items.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> They should realize that these items could be sorted by shape, border color, or fill. Which means that this item could either belong in Box 2 (squares) or Box 3 (black outline or red fill). Having more data available, i.e. more sorted items on screen, would help them make a more accurate guess.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide20.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students move the item into Box 2 if it is not already there.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide21.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students locate and move the remaining items into Boxes 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Note that there are more shapes on screen than appear in students’ playspace. If you are using physical manipulatives, students may have more items to sort.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide22.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students sort this item in one of the three boxes by clicking and dragging it into the box. <br /><br />🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> “If you already sorted this item during the previous slide, you should know which Box this item belongs in.”<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide23.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Have students discuss how accurate they were in the first round. How many of them knew the item belonged in Box 1? How about in Round 2? And Round 3? How did having more data sorted in each round, help students make a more accurate prediction of where to put the item on screen.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should understand that having more data available to them will make their predictions more accurate. In the first round, they had no information and had to make a guess. In the second round, they had slightly more information but were still making a guess. In the third round, they had already seen the item sorted into Box 3 and should not have had to guess at all. <br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide24.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Have students think about what would happen if they had to sort the three items on screen. Remind them that in the first round, they had no information to go off of and had to make a guess. Similarly, the pentagon, heart, and smiley face don’t appear in the training data so students would have to guess what box to put them in.<br /><br />Then have students discuss how the items were sorted by shape. <br /><br />🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> If I had sorted these items by something other than shape, how would that have affected how you sorted your items?<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should understand that they are acting as a computer responding to data inputs. Had you sorted your items by something other than shape, then they would have mirrored that. This leads into the next activity where students will get to redo the previous 3 rounds, but sorting their items by something other than triangle, circle, and square.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide25.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> For the second time through this activity, one student will “train” the model on data and their partner will guess how the data is sorted.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide26.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Group students in pairs. Have students click “Reset” on level one. Have one student act as the trainer and give them a minute to sort the items on their screen however they want. They should keep their screen hidden from their partner until the end of Round 3. Have the other partner act as the Guesser. This student will complete the same steps as in Round 1.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide27.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have the Guesser to click the orange Run button under the playspace and look for the item on screen. Have Guessers store this item in one of the three boxes by clicking and dragging it into the box. Since students won’t have enough information yet to know where the item should go, they should take a guess. <br /><br />Have the Guesser show their screen to the Trainer and have the Trainer tell the Guesser if they are correct or if they need to move the item to a different box. The Trainer should keep their screen hidden from the Guesser.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide28.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Ask students “What features does this item have?” They should note that it is shaped like a triangle, it has a green border, and it has a yellow fill. Ask students how they decided what box to put it in. <br /><br />Have the Trainer reflect on what information the Guesser currently has.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students may say that they took a guess or that they looked at specific features of the item. Both ways reflect how a computer would also decide what box to put the item in. Trainers should understand that at this point in the activity, Guessers have no information about how to sort the items on screen.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide29.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students sort these 3 items into the correct boxes if it is not already there. The example on screen is taken from Part One of the activity. Note that Trainers might have sorted their items differently. If so, have the Trainer indicate to the Guesser where on their screen to drag these three items.<br /><br />🔁 <strong>Circulate:</strong> As students complete this activity, see if you can find different ways that Trainers have sorted their items. Call on these students to explain how they sorted their data at the end of Part Two.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide30.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students store this item in one of the three boxes by clicking and dragging it into the box.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide31.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Ask students if they can guess how these items are sorted. Then ask what information they could receive that would help them to be more accurate in sorting additional items.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> They should note that these items could be sorted by shape, border color, or fill. Having more data available, i.e. more sorted items on screen, would help them make a more accurate guess.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide32.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students locate and move the remaining items into Boxes 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

Highlight a couple students who sorted their data in different ways.<br /><br />Discuss if knowing that the items were sorted by shape in Part One helped in Part Two.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should be able to explain how their Trainer sorted the data by Round 3. Students should understand that knowing one way to sort a set of items doesn’t provide them with any additional information when starting the process over. Each time they perform this activity, they are starting with a blank slate. Similarly, each time a new machine learning model is trained, we assume that it has no prior knowledge and we must provide it with appropriately tagged and sorted data.<br /><br />☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> If there is additional time and students want to do a Part Three of this activity. Have the Guesser and Trainer switch roles and have the new Trainer choose a new feature to sort the items by.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide35.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide36.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Review the day’s learning objectives and have students reflect on how they accomplished each of these during the activity. <br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide37.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Ask students “How do computers become more accurate at making predictions?” <br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should be able to explain that computers are similar to humans in that they require lots of data to make accurate predictions. For example, it helps to have seen the exact item before in order to correctly classify it.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide38.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Show students the short (1 min) video in the link. Then, have students summarize how this tool initially was developed and what it is used for now. See if students can come up with examples of how a sorting algorithm could be used in the real world. <br /><br />Some hypothetical examples: sorting between dogs and cats, laundry sorter that sorts pants/shirts/socks, sorting out M&Ms from the rest of the trail mix. <br /><br />Some real world examples: self-driving cars detecting empty crosswalks vs. a pedestrian crossing, sorting by trash/compost/recycling, Roomba vacuums determining if there is an obstacle or not, detecting if an email/text/call is spam or not. <br /><br />Here are some additional news examples:<br /><br />Food Waste Is a Serious Problem. AI Is Trying to Solve It<br />AI system used to create a patrol route for conservationists to help prevent poaching attacks<br />AI tech can identify genetic disorders from a person's face<br />MIT AI tool can predict breast cancer up to 5 years early<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide39.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Here are two additional read aloud extensions to show students. While these books were not designed for teaching about machine learning or sorting algorithms, their content can be used to start a discussion about features that the different characters or buttons have. Encourage students to start noticing patterns around them in the classroom and beyond where items might be sorted by their features.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide40.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide41.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide42.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide43.png"></td><td>✏️ <strong>Vocabulary:</strong> Read aloud the vocabulary words written on the slide.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide44.png"></td><td>✏️ <strong>Vocabulary:</strong> Read aloud the vocabulary words written on screen<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide45.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Read aloud the objectives written on the screen<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide46.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have a student read the Question of the Day aloud<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide47.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Generate a selection of random books using the Random Books Generator site. Show students the 6 books that were generated. Then, search for a student’s favorite book on Amazon and scroll down to look at Items to Explore. For example, check out More items to explore on this search for Sideways Stories from Wayside School.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide48.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Have students discuss the similarities and differences between how books were generated on these two websites. They should reflect on which books they preferred and how their preferences might differ from people around them.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should be able to explain that the Random Book Generator site generates books randomly from an unsorted/untagged list of books. If you were to keep clicking “Generate” it would pick 6 books randomly from the list each time. Amazon collects data associate with each book, for example it tracks what other books were bought by people who bought the book searched for. It also uses a recommendation algorithm to look for similar books (author, grade level, content) to the book being searched for that it then recommends.<br /><br />Students will likely find books in the random book generator that are not at the right reading level for them or that they don’t find interesting. In comparison, Amazon might recommend more familiar or relevant books. They should understand that if their parent/friend/teacher/librarian clicks “Generate” on the random book generator they are equally likely to get the same book recommendations. However, if they type in their own favorite book into Amazon’s search, they will get more customized recommendations.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide49.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide50.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Play the video for students. <br /><br />Pause at 0:31<br /><br />🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> What does the speaker mean when she says computers learn through “trial and error” and “lots of practice”?<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Have students reflect on the previous lesson. Sometimes they made a guess about what box to put an item in and they were incorrect. The Trainer then corrected the guess and moved on to practice with the next item. This is an example of “trial and error” or supervised learning. A machine learning model gets fed data, makes predictions, and then gets feedback based on how accurate those predictions were in order to make better predictions in the future.<br /><br />Pause at 1:06<br /><br />🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> How do you think this Bot is able to tell the difference between cars and bikes? <br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should be able to explain that this bot was trained on many different images which were tagged as either a bicycle or a car. Some features that it might be looking for: 2 or 4 wheels, how much of the background is visible behind the image, windows or no windows, handlebars or no handlebars.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide51.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Transition students to their devices. Have them go to Level 2 and sort the items, training the algorithm to recognize fish. <br /><br />Teaching Tip: Before allowing students on their devices, consider modeling this level for the class<br />Depending on how ready your students are for independent online activities and how comfortable they are reading the text on screen, you may want to complete this level as a class. Display this level for the whole class to see. As you train AI Bot, have the whole class give a thumbs up or thumbs down to indicate whether the model should recognize the item as a fish or not.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide52.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students complete Levels 3 and 4 on their own devices. Level 3 introduces the idea that “AI only learns what we teach it”. Students should be aware that we want to train our model to recognize all creatures that belong in the water. In Level 3, students will retrain the model to recognize fish, otters, dolphins, and more.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide53.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students complete Level 5 by choosing a word to teach A.I. If multiple students choose the same word, have them compare their results. Students should start to notice that even though they chose the same word as a classmate, their training data might have differed.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide54.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Ask students to compare their results with another classmate who chose the same word as them. They may need to run through Level 4 one more time to retrain their model.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should be able to explain that their training dataset reflects their own opinions. Students might have different opinions about which fish looks “Fast” or “Happy” because these words are subjective, meaning they could be different for each person. <br /><br />If students were to label only blue fish as “angry” and only red fish as “awesome”, the computer would learn that biased pattern and might start labeling all blue fish as “angry” or all the red fish as “awesome” even when they're not. These inaccurate predictions, or bias, could cause issues in the future if the computer learns something untrue about a particular type of fish. Having more data and making sure it represents all types of fish can help solve this problem and avoid biased input data.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide55.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide56.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Review the day’s learning objectives and have students reflect on how they accomplished each of these during the activity. <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide57.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Ask students “How can you prevent bias in your training data?<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students should understand that training data can be subjective, for example what an “angry” fish looks like. It helps to consider multiple opinions when tagging data that could be based on opinions. Also, students should consider multiple scenarios and not just the most common scenario in order to account for all possible outcomes. Students will get more practice doing this in the Wrap Up question.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide58.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> How does Attendance Bot make things easier (pros) and harder (cons), when might it get things wrong, and how can this be avoided?<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Have students consider that this app may not always be more accurate than a teacher taking attendance because it can only see the class at one specific moment in time (cons). On the flip side, it might make a teacher’s life easier because it automates a task that a teacher would have to do by hand (pro). Students might also consider how the app can’t ask questions or see nuanced scenarios, such as a student present but not in their seat. Have students consider examples of when Attendance Bot might be wrong where a human would not be.<br /><br />Examples of when Attendance Bot might mark a present student as absent:<br />If the student is present but somewhere else in the classroom, e.g. at the teacher’s desk, passing out papers, in another seat<br />If the student is kneeling in their chair or bending down to pick something off the floor<br />If a student is in the bathroom<br />If the student is in a wheelchair or uses a mobility device that prevents them from being able to sit in the school chair<br /><br />The makers of Attendance Bot should consider the different scenarios above when training their AI. They might also want to have the Bot take attendance throughout the day to make sure that it is more accurate.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide59.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide60.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide61.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide62.png"></td><td>✏️ <strong>Vocabulary:</strong> Read aloud the vocabulary words written on screen<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide63.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Read aloud the objectives written on the screen<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide64.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have a student read the Question of the Day aloud<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide65.png"></td><td>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Have students discuss what possible pets an AI pet picker might think of given the adjectives “small” and “furry”.

For example: “playful”, “barks”, “furry tail”.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Sometimes, the same prompt given to AI could lead to multiple different answers. Students should start to understand why AI might sometimes make inaccurate predictions given a limited set of information. You can connect this to the sorting activity that students did in the first lesson. Given the same set of items (inputs), a computer might sort them differently depending on if it was trained on shape, fill color, or border color. Because many AI chatbots out there today are trained on ALL the data on the internet, there might be conflicting opinions which could lead to conflicting outcomes, e.g. choosing a rat instead of a puppy or sorting by shape instead of by fill color.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide66.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide67.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Transition students to their devices.

You assigned a numerical value to an item based on its features. <br /><br />Now, we’re going to act as an AI snack picker. I’m looking for a food you like to eat that is sweet. Find the item that’s closest to a 10 on the “Sweetness” scale and a 10 on the “Like to eat” scale. In other words, go to the top right corner of your feature vector and choose one item from that corner. For example, Carla would choose “pineapple” because that is the food that she thinks is the sweetest and that she likes to eat the most. <br /><br />☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have each student identify one item in the top right corner of their feature vector .<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide70.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students raise their hands to share what item they picked.

For example, according to the tally above, strawberries is the most popular with 10 votes. Then, have students determine which is the second most popular result. In this example, watermelon with 8 votes is the second most popular.<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Since AI chooses based on probabilities, students should know that strawberries are most likely to be chosen by AI snack picker with watermelon being second most likely. Strawberries and watermelon will not always get chosen, but they will get chosen more often than pineapple or banana.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide71.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Play the video for students. <br /><br />Pause at 0:20<br /><br />🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> What information was this AI Bot trained on?<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> AI is learning to recognize different emojis and associate words with them. It’s using information taken from the internet to determine what words fit with each emoji.<br /><br />Pause at 1:15<br /><br />💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> Why does AI Bot sometimes make a prediction that’s different from one that you or I would make?  <br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Make sure students understand that AI is trained on billions of data points representing many different opinions. Since not everyone agrees on for example, what colors are in a sunset, AI will make a prediction based on the probabilities of different responses. If most people say that a sunset contains the color orange, then AI will usually say “orange”. But since sometimes people see purple in a sunset, occasionally AI will say “purple”.<br /><br />Have students reflect on the previous activity where they sorted food. Point out how each student arranged their items differently on the chart. What would happen if an AI snack picker was trained on ALL the charts in the class? It might not pick the snack that you or I picked, but it would certainly reflect someone’s opinion in the class.<br /><br />Additionally, in our food example, AI snack picker was only trained to recognize food on a scale from Not sweet to Very sweet and Not for me! to Love it! In reality, an AI snack picker might be trained on many more features of an item such as: healthiness, cost, availability, size, salty, spicy, etc. Taking into consideration all of these factors will lead AI to sometimes make different predictions than you or I would make.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide72.png"></td><td>🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> In this level, you will use a block to make AI Bot generate foreground and background effects for your dance.

See if students can explain why the three emojis at the top 🏁(checkered flag), 🎉 (party), and 💎(gem) led AI Bot to generate the background effects Black and White, Diamonds, and Confetti, as shown in code and in the bottom right effects square. Why did AI Bot not choose one of the other 4 options?<br /><br />💡 <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Connect this screen back to the activity students did with sorting fruit and vegetables. AI Bot had multiple options that would have fit for “sweet” and “like to eat”. For example, it was more likely to pick strawberries and watermelon over pineapple and banana. Just as there could be multiple options for AI snack picker to choose from, AI Bot had different effects to choose from that were associated with the three emojis. <br /><br />For example, if we were to run this again with the same emojis, we might find that instead of choosing “Black and White”, AI Bot could have chosen a “Grayscale” color scheme. Or instead of choosing “Confetti” for the foreground effect, it might have chosen “Starburst”. When clicking “Regenerate” students are able to see other choices that AI Bot has made given the same set of 3 emojis. <br /><br />On the flip side, AI Bot did not choose the other four options because they were much less associated with 🏁(checkered flag), 🎉 (party), and 💎(gem). Specifically, AI Bot passed over the “Rose Squiggles”, “Autumn Clouds”, “Sunrise Disco Ball”, and “Sky Frosted Grid” background effects in favor of “Black and White Diamonds”. Note that in most of the other 4 options AI still chose the “Confetti” foreground effect. This effect is closely associated with the  🎉 (party) emoji, as evidenced by the thicker pink bar in the different association bar charts.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide75.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Open Level 2 on your screen and display it to the whole class.

There should be a partnership between humans and AI so that we are not entrusting AI to make the final decision or to operate unchecked. <br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide81.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide82.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide83.png"></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide84.png"></td><td>✏️ <strong>Vocabulary:</strong> Read aloud the vocabulary words written on screen<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide85.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Read aloud the objectives written on the screen<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide86.png"></td><td>☑️ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have a student read the Question of the Day aloud<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://dancodedotorg.github.io/testing-slides/1T-GelzEMIvpJqIjddzcwGuNeXV3SKhYRggsK-rHYcNI/slide87.png"></td><td>🎙️ <strong>Say:</strong> We’re going to collect some data of our own.
