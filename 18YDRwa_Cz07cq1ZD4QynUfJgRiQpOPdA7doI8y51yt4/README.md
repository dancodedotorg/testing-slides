The model is typically that a term or concept is introduced and modeled and then afterwards students are encouraged to try it out on their own. Trying it out typically means they are writing information on a sticky note and sharing it with another group before discussing the results with the whole class.<br>Slides with animations have an icon in the bottom left corner to let you know you need to click to reveal more of the slide's content.<br>To help you more easily prepare the activity and keep track of your instructions, detailed instructions have been included as speaker notes in the presentation. Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.<br>There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.<br>There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.<br>The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.<br>Both you and students can use the "Key Takeaways" to check your understanding at the end.<br><br></p> |

It demonstrates all the possible combinations of true and false and what they would evaluate to if combined with the logical operator &#x26;&#x26; (AND). The first one seems obvious to us - if something is true and another thing is true, then the whole thing is true!. Read through each row, and consider what is being stated. In rows 2 and 3, if one value is false, the whole thing evaluates to false. This is what happened with the cat example.
