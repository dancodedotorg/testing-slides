On the next screen, you will see a list of “words”. Decide which ones are truly words like you can play in Scrabble and which are not.
		<br />
		<br />Teaching Tip: Classroom Prep
		<br />Before beginning this warmup, consider how you will manage the discussion on the next slide where students are sorting terms into “words” or “not words”. Consider having two sheets of poster paper that you can write on as the class sorts, or consider making a table on a whiteboard and writing the results there. You could also consider presenting these slides in “edit” mode so you can move the text boxes around on the screen, but make sure you are able to reset the choices between class periods if you teach this lesson to multiple classes in the same day.

              <i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Discuss:</strong> Have students discuss in groups before sharing out as a full class. Instead of going line-by-line through these words, ask students which decisions they are “most confident” about and sharing their classification for those words first. Using this strategy, students will likely sort “1) banana” and “6) shirt” as words, and “2) aka7sj23ksw” and “7) @&!*@^#” as not words. The remaining words are deliberately chosen to motivate certain discussions and create moments of cognitive dissonance and curiosity, hopefully allowing students to lead the discussion by asking questions or respectfully challenging ideas. Let students know they will likely change their minds as the discussion continues and that’s okay, and allowing students to state their confidence level for their initial thoughts can make them more comfortable speaking up since it feels less “high-stakes”. Be prepared to address the following situations in this discussion:
		<br />
		<br />3) cherimoya is a fruit common to South America, but may not be a common fruit your students have heard of. It’s possible many students may say “this isn’t a word”, but one or two students may speak up because they’re familiar with this fruit. Be sure to elevate those voices and highlight how our own knowledge is sometimes limited by lack of exposure to different words or phrases. Or, if no one raises this point, be sure to point this out to students explicitly such as showing them the Wikipedia page. In either case, make sure cherimoya is classified as a “word” before leaving the discussion
		<br />
		<br />8) ullaakkut and 10) yá'át'ééh are both words in other languages - ullaakkut means hello in Inuktitut, a language spoken by Inuit peoples in Canada and Greenland; and yá'át'ééh means “hello” in the Navajo / Diné language. Similar to above, students may initially classify these as not words because they are unfamiliar with them, but it is important to surface the meaning and use of these words to students either with a quick google search or elevating the voice of a student in class who is already familiar with these words. As a result, make sure these terms don’t end up in the “Not Words” category by the end of the discussion.
		<br />
		<br />4) wierd is a misspelling of either the word “weird” or the word “wired”. Students may initially say that this is “not a word”, but another student or yourself should challenge them by pointing out that if this is typed into a device with autocorrect, it will automatically correct it to one of these other words. Even in this slide deck, the word has a red squiggly underline representing that the computer recognizes it as something, even if it’s not a correctly spelled word. This may inspire the class to create a new category to represent this term - it’s not a correctly spelled word, but it’s also not a made-up word, so maybe there’s a new category for “misspelled words” or “important terms that aren’t words”. Let students guide how they want to handle this situation, even if they decide not to make a new category and it remains in “not word”.
		<br />
		<br />At some point, students who are more familiar with the Scrabble game may try to invoke the “rules of Scrabble” which restrict words in other languages, proper nouns, or abbreviations. From this perspective, words (8) and (10) above would be restricted, as would 5) Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland) and 9) ATM (since it is an abbreviation for Automatic Teller Machine). If this comes up, use this as an opportunity to question the effect that arbitrary rules have on what we consider valid language, since these are all definitely words that are used in society even if not officially allowed in Scrabble. You could consider creating new categories to represent these phrases, such as “Still words but not allowed in Scrabble” or “Part of language, but not allowed in Scrabble”. Or, the class could decide these belong in the Words category, regardless of what Scrabble thinks, and that’s the end of the story.
		<br />
		<br /><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Ultimately, this is an exercise to surface that the way we identify words versus nonsense - much like Calvin and Hobbes in the comic panel - can be contextual to our lived experiences and influences what we consider important information versus random noise that can be ignored. It’s okay if the discussion ends without closure, so long as students have wrestled with how what they initially considered “words” may have been expanded as they were exposed to new contexts in the discussion. However, be very intentional that the discussion ends with very few items in the “Not Words” category, especially making sure ullaakkut and yá'át'ééh are not in this category and are instead classified as either a Word or a new category the class has created.

		<br />
		<br />Teaching Tip: Viewing Tokens
		<br />If your school district allows access, OpenAI has a website that lets you preview how it interprets words and converts them into tokens: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer. This can be a helpful visualization of how words are broken apart and interpreted by large language models. Consider demonstrating this for the class and typing in example sentences. Most words will likely be interpreted as single words, but compound words like “decapod”, “anthology”, “pretense”, and “arachnophobia” are interpreted as two tokens instead of one.

		<br />
		<br />Since the first example is “This Classroom”, you could do an example together as a class and point out any posters or books or anything with text. An easy example is the slide itself being projected, which would help a language model represent words like “Do”, “Complete”, Include”, etc.

		<br />
		<br />Set a short timer for this activity. When a group is finished, their poster paper essentially represents a language model trained from a variety of sources curated by each student. These can be referred to in later parts of the unit as our understanding of language models evolves.

		<br />
		<br />Teaching Tip: What Do Models “Know” At This Point?
		<br />The language being used in this lesson is very intentional, saying that models can “represent” words as opposed to “know” or “understand”. Students may pick up on this and ask what the models really “know” or “understand” at this point, or you may hear students saying the model “knows what this word means” which isn’t quite correct. At this stage, all we’re doing is building a “word bank” that a model can recognize and eventually reproduce. But the model doesn’t have any inherent understanding of the meaning of these words - this happens in later steps and later lessons. If we asked a model to respond to a prompt just with the training done today, it could generate any of the words students are putting on their posters, but the results would be random and nonsensical since it doesn’t have any tools to help it make decisions about which words are best used in which situations. Nevertheless, this is a necessary step in understanding how a language model works - a model can’t even begin to “understand” a word if it’s not even included in it’s training data.

		<br /><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> In responding to this prompt, students are implicitly describing how their choices and perspectives are influencing what a language model is capable of understanding. When several posters have similar words, it’s because they all collectively referenced the same source material (such as words sourced from the same classroom). And when posters have unique words, it’s because they chose to include data sources that may be less common across different groups. This emphasizes a broader point for language models: humans control what data a model is trained on, which influences the types of words it is capable of representing.
		<br />
		<br />Teaching Tip: Lost Languages
		<br />There is an opportunity to connect this back to the warm-up, where two words in Native and Indigenous languages may not have been immediately recognized by the class. The same is true for large-language models, where entire languages or phrases may be left out of digital representation unless we choose to include them as part of the training material. Consider highlighting the work of Michael Running Wolf if you or your students are interested in learning more about someone working to solve these problems.

		<br />Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment
		<br />The following prompts can be used as a formative assessment to see how members of the class understand the relationship between data sources used as input and the types of words a language model can represent from that source. You can get a pulse-check on this understanding by listening to how students respond as a class, or having them discuss in groups first and listen in on the conversations, or have students use the blank space on the back of their activity guide to write down their answers before responding. If you notice students are struggling to answer these questions, consider doing one or two as a class to model how students should think about this relationship between training data and what a model can represent.

		<br />
		<br /><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> This is intended to be a quick question with a single right answer: The internet. If students give answers other than this, continue to prompt them with “Yah, but what’s even bigger than that…” and work towards getting students to consider the internet as a large data source. If the conversation reaches a lull, just tell the class “The Internet”.
		<br />
		<br /><i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Say:</strong> The models we’ve started to make today are a great start and represent a good starting collection of words, but can’t possibly encompass all of the data we’d need to represent the entire world and all of its complexity. To solve this, most modern large language models are trained on huge collections of information usually from the internet, such as the entirety of wikipedia. By using such large quantities of data, large-language models are able to build up huge libraries of words they recognize and represent natural language.
		<br />
		<br />Teaching Tip: Looking Inside the Box
		<br />The article “Inside the secret list of websites that make AI like ChatGPT sound smart” from the Washington Post has a detailed list of how the internet and various websites have been used to train current large-language models. We don’t recommend using this article for classroom use as aspects may not be appropriate, but the interactive web version of the article (link here) includes an interactive component where you can type in the name of a website and see if it’s been used to train large language models (if the website is behind a paywall, consider investigating if your local library allows limited free access). This can be a useful illustration of just how much data was used to train large-language models.
